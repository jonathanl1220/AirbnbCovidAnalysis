# An analysis of COVID – 19’s effect on the Airbnb market in Manhattan; focused on June 2019 and June 2020
As a New Yorker I am interested in how the home rental market was affected by Covid - 19 in Manhattan. 
The objective is to observe if there was a change in the Mean Price and Listing for the two periods. 

# Data Source 
I gathered my data from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html.
The data consist of June 2019 and June 2020 Listings data.

# Background Information
-Average daily rates were higher for rentals in July 2020 versus July 2019 in the United States — from about $300 to $323. 

-Home rentals have outperformed hotels in 27 global markets since the onset of Covid-19.

-Airbnb is the biggest player in the short-term rental space 7 million listings in over 220 countries.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

To better understand the data I wanted to use some exploratory data analysis to determine what section of the dataset I  would utilize.
The data consist of listing through the five boroughs so I wanted to start with the listings per borough.
